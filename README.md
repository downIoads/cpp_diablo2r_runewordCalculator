# cpp_diablo2r_runewordCalculator
GUI tool for Windows/Linux that has been my personal Diablo 2 Resurrected assistant for the last years!
Updated for the currently newest patch 2.7!

It uses wxWidgets for the GUI and supports the following features:

* Calculates possible runewords (You select which runes you have, which item type base, how many sockets, and optionally a level requirement and it will list all possible runewords you can make)

* Breakpoints for all classes (IBS, FCR, FHR). Attack speed currently not supported but I can recommend https://d2.lc/IAS/

* List of runewords (In case you know the name of a runeword and want to check what it does)

* Rune conversions (Hover your mouse over a rune and it will tell you how to upgrade this rune, what this rune is upgraded from and also which effect this rune has when socketed)

* Sort Runes A-Z or by rarity (sometimes by rarity is better, but sometimes you just want to know how to upgrade ITH in the cube and you know where it is alphabetically but you might not be able to find it quickly if the runes are sorted by rarity)

* Rune word information (lists exact details of every runeword, if runeword has different effect for different item types these are listed too)
